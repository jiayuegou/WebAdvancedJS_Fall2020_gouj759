      <p>
        My camera is created in response to our extensive use of zoom this
        semester. Since the start of Covid-19, most schools went online, and
        webcam became our most used means of communication, yet I’m not someone
        who is comfortable on camera. I just feel like I’m sitting in front of
        my laptop for the majority of the time these days, and the only way
        someone can get to know me is through this tiny window on zoom. There
        are other aspects about me that could be easily ignored compared to
        in-person interaction. As someone who is not comfortable on camera, I
        want to create a filter that disguises my appearance without completely
        erasing myself from the video so that my gesture and perhaps my
        expressions is showing without actually showing my face. This way people
        can still see me without actually seeing me. I think it’s also a fun
        twist to video chat. This camera is designed for myself or anyone else
        who is like me.
      </p>

        Design Process

        All three of my initial ideas are related to identity disguise because
        as someone who is not comfortable on camera, I have to spend a large
        amount of time on zoom nowadays. The first one captures people in a
        pixelated filter, so that only the gesture of the body is captured with
        the actual appearance hidden. The second idea is to use the clmtrackr to
        track the face and block part of the facial features as a way of
        identity disguise. The third idea captures only the outline of the body,
        so the only thing showing is the background. I decided to go with the
        first one because I think it best expressed my idea, and I also really
        liked how it looks the most. I experimented with pixel array and
        manipulated the brightness value to achieve the final result. I used two
        of my favorite colors to represent the light and dark area of the filter
        as a way of expressing my identity, and when the mouse is pressed, there
        is also a change in the blending of the filter. I also added a slider
        that controls the brightness value of the camera.

        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        I have experimented with so many fun functions for this project. I tried
        using the clmtrackr to explore facial recognition and make camera
        filters out of it. I also tried pixel array, which is what I decided to
        use for my final project. I encountered difficulties and definitely also
        learned a lot during the process. This project is really interesting
        because it made me think and explore the concept of seeing and how
        camera can be manipulated and shaped in an unconventional way.
