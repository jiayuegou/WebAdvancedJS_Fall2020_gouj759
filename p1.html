      <h2>
        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        Xintong's lost object: It was a gift from her host family a few years
        ago. It was a silver bangle. There was a circular charm attached to it
        with the word "family" engraved on it.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>

      <p>
        I mainly just used ellipses and circles in this project. I didnâ€™t want
        the whole thing to be plain grey so I used different tones of greys and
        white to show the reflection and shadow of the silver.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth"></div>

      <p></p>

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        The description given to me were pretty simple and straightforward. I
        immediately had the picture of the lost object in my head as my partner
        described it. Because the object itself was pretty straightforward, I
        dived directly into coding instead of sketching out the object on a
        piece of paper first. However, as I was coding, I realized that it is
        not a simple task as it appears to be. The object was simple because it
        was given to me and there were no complex shapes, but the entire object
        is silver which is a pretty hard color to show, especially using only
        codes. It took me a whole to figure out how to layer different shapes
        and colors to best present the silver color. It was much harder to
        produce a picture using codes but it was definitely a lot of fun.
