      <h2>
        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        This is the recording of a personal habit for 7 days. I have this bad
        habit of playing with my hair such as twirling or twisting, and
        sometimes even pulling and tugging whenever I feel stressed or anxious.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          class="large"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/a52bb57d-9dc4-47cc-ab86-e3be936c556a%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-12-11%20at%209.13.17%20AM.png?v=1607649250088"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        I divided each day into three part: morning (5:00am-11:59am), afternoon
        (12:00pm-4:59pm) and evening (5:00pm-4:59am). At first I was tracking
        the specific time each time I played with my hair, but when the number
        gets bigger, there were just too many data points to deal with.
        Therefore I decided to just track the number of times I played with my
        hair within each time period, and I felt like it was enough to reflect
        my habit. I've also categorized the ways I play with my hair into
        twirling/twisting and pulling/tugging according to the severity level.
        As for the sketch, I divided the canvas into three sections, and each
        corresponds to a time period in a day. I used two different ellipses to
        represent the two categories of playing, and they are mapped out onto
        the canvas according to the different time periods.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        I think this sketch not only visualizes my habit of playing with my hair
        but also reflects my work habit in relation to stress level in a way. As
        I mentioned before this is a habit that tends to occur when I'm
        stressed, and in most cases, this is usually when I'm working on a
        project. For example, on day 3, I pulled an allnighter working on a
        project, therefore the frequency of me playing with my hair is
        significantly higher than usual. The time where there's little to no
        activity is normally the time I'm asleep, and it is clear that I go to
        bed too late and the pattern is not regular at all, so this also helps
        me realize how unhealthy my daily routine can be. The most important
        thing I gained through this self-tracking experience is that I notice
        myself playing a lot less with my hair during the process because I was
        being mindful each time I do it. I'm trying to quit this habit so I
        might make the self-tracking a regular thing to help myself with it.
