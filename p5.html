      <h2>
        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        Move your cursor around to discover the hidden message.
      </p>

      <p>
        My idea for this project is inspired by the overexposure of our personal
        data on social media nowadays. Our personal information or data is
        constantly gathered and analyzed by people or companies without our
        consent. Anything we search or browse on social media can be a source of
        data analyzed by companies. Every advertisement popping up on our social
        media page is carefully chosen for us to fit our preferences using
        algorithm. My intention is to embed the message that we are constantly
        being watched while using any social media. The recipient would be
        anyone who uses social media on a daily basis.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>

      <p>
        I tried using the preload function for the first time to load the images
        of the ads I prepared on the phone screen, and I incorporated second()
        to achieve the scrolling effect as if we are actually scrolling through
        the social media page on a phone. I used for Loop to draw the glitch
        effect on the background. Originally I only wanted the glitch effect
        when the hidden message is discovered, but then I like how it looked in
        the background, so I kept it. When the message is shown, the glitch
        extends to the screen. I also incorporated user-defined functions mostly
        when drawing the frame of the phone and using the for Loop function
        because I was calling the same functions over and over again. It saved
        me a lot of space.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        As a heavy social media user, I wanted to create something that relates
        the paradox of our reliance on social media and the overexposure of
        personal data while using them because this is something that has always
        bothered me. I’m very reliant on social media and I don’t think I can
        ever quit using them, but at the same time I don’t feel comfortable
        being watched and analyzed. I think we should be mindful of what we
        share on social media because we are constantly under surveillance. It
        took me a while to figure out the right visual strategy I wanted to
        adopt. There were a lot of iterations, and I’m quite happy with the
        final result. I especially like how the scrolling of social media ads is
        interrupted by glitch when the hidden message is discovered. I think the
        glitch effect really ties in with the phone screen.
