      <p>
        This is a game about procrastination. I want to create this because I’m
        personally someone who tends to procrastinate and I’m trying my best to
        fight it. This game is basically a simple experience to mimic the
        process of fighting with procrastination. There are three levels in
        total, and each lever is meant to represent a stage of struggling and
        fighting with procrastination.
      </p>

        The main character is me, I drew a little girl as the main character to
        represent myself.

      <p>
        These are my draft storyboards and the Gray-boxed version of my game.
        The first level of the game requires player to click really fast to
        boost the motivation, otherwise the motivation level will gradually drop
        to zero. When the motivation level is zero, the player loses the game
        because it means that the players is beaten by procrastination. The
        second level is to reach the other end while dodging all the temptations
        along the way, just like how we resist playing with our phones or other
        stuffs while working or studying in real life. The final level is a
        simple maze that people need to go through in order to finish the
        project before the deadline. Player will have 5 lives in total for the
        last two levels. Everytime the character is bumped with the obstacles
        along the way or fails to stay within the boundary of the maze, one life
        will be deducted. When all the lifes are gone, the game is over.

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        This is definitely the hardest assignment I have done so far because I
        had to combine everything I have learned in this class to complete this
        project. This is challenging but also a very good opportunity because it
        not only allows me to revisit and reinforce the things I learned in the
        past, but I was also able to gaine a lot of new knowledge through this
        assignment. I feel like I can do a lot more with coding after this
        assignment. Through constantly debugging and solving problems I
        encountered, I was able to gain better understanding about coding.
        Despite that, there are still issues existing in my game, and I’m
        constantly going back to optimize it. There is always room for
        improvement.
