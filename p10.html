        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        My translation device is to visualize air pollution, people can search
        for a place with coordinates to see the air pollution situation there. I
        chose to reference the third feminist data principal: On Rational,
        Scientific, Objective Viewpoints from Mythical, Imaginary, Impossible
        Standpoints, which is to elevate emotion and embodiment, and value
        multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from
        people as living, feeling bodies in the world. Air pollution is an
        important topic we always hear about but can't always see with our own
        eyes, I think this feminist data prinple is suitable to apply to this
        issue as visualizing the air pollution data can make it easier to grasp
        and more compelling.

        My original idea was to work with the youtube API to visualize the most
        watched category of video in different regions. However I was having a
        hard time working with it so I decided to change direction.

      <p>API <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">link</a></p>

      <p>
        After searching for a while, I decided to work with the air pollution
        API from OpenWeatherMap. My orginal idea was to visualize the data on a
        map like what I imagine for the Youtube API, but after some thinking I
        decided to use my second idea to have the viewer search for the place
        they want to see because it allows more room for visualization and the
        infomation would be less overwhelming, which is more suitable for my
        chosen reference of feminist data. This API allows me to extract current
        air pollution data for any coordinates on the globe. I used ellipses of
        different size and color to visualize the amount of Carbon monoxide
        (CO), Ozone (O3), and particulates (PM2.5 and PM10) in the air, and the
        viewer is able to type in the latitude and longitude information of a
        place to see a visualization of the current air pollution there. I'm
        currently having some trouble pulling that information from the API so
        I'm still working on the visuals. More details about the visuals coming.

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        This is a challenging assignment. It took me a while to just understand
        and figure out how to work with an API. It also took me a long time
        finding an API that works well and also allows me to create something
        that responds to one of the feminist data principles, but overall I
        really enjoyed the process of learning to use API and incorporate it in
        my sketch, I think it would allow me to do a lot more with coding in the
        future. I was responding to the third principle of the feminist data. I
        think turning the air pollution data into visulization is able to
        elevate emotion and embodiment like what the principle has described and
        make the data easier to grasp and remember, as people are naturally more
        drawn to visual elements than plain texts and numbers. Although I think
        I can work on the visual elements a bit more.
