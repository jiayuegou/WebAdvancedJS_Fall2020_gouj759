        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        This is a follow-up assignment of the previous experimental camera
        assignment. I add some interface to my camera so that the whole
        experience is consentful. My original camera is created in response to
        our extensive use of zoom this semester. Since the start of Covid-19,
        most schools went online, and webcam became our most used means of
        communication, yet I’m not someone who is comfortable on camera. I just
        feel like I’m sitting in front of my laptop for the majority of the time
        these days, and the only way someone can get to know me is through this
        tiny window on zoom. As someone who is not comfortable on camera, I want
        to create a filter that disguises my appearance without completely
        erasing myself from the video so that my gesture and perhaps my
        expressions is showing without actually showing my face. This way people
        can still see me without actually seeing me. I think it’s also a fun
        twist to video chat. This camera is designed for myself or anyone else
        who is like me.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/a52bb57d-9dc4-47cc-ab86-e3be936c556a%2Fflowchart.png?v=1605986982693"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        The camera starts with a start page with the name of the camera and a
        start button shown. Once the users click on start, more detailed
        information about the camera (including the ideas behind it) will be
        shown. Users have the option to click exit or next. If next is selected
        the camera will ask for permission to access the users’ webcam, and it
        is made clear that none of their personal data will be collected. Again,
        the user has the option to go back to allow the access. Once the access
        is allowed, the camera will appear. Users have the option to exit the
        camera at any time. This is also a slider for the users to adjust the
        brightness level as they want.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        I have designed my consent interface in response to the F.R.I.E.S model.
        It keeps the users well informed about what they are dealing with, while
        also allowing the users to exit anytime. This assignment allows me to
        think more about the issues of consent which is normally neglected by
        most people. I believe we’ve all experienced some forms of privacy
        violation, therefore it is important for us to think about these issues
        especially when we design.
