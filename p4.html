      <h2>
        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        An unusual mermaid with a fish head, a minion's body, and human legs.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>

      <p>
        My partners: Mang Kipgen, Shivanjali Verma, Yiwen Zhang
      </p>

      <p>
        The drawings I selected are the fish by Mang representing a school
        teacher (the first picture), Yiwen’s minion (the second picture), and my
        own anthropomorphic flowers representing different moods and
        personalities (the third picture). The resulting sketch is composed of a
        fish head, a minion’s body, and the legs from my flowers (the last
        picture). I didn’t realize until I put them together that the
        combination of the three generates an unusual mermaid figure. The
        mermaids that we normally conceive have human faces and fish tails,
        while in this case, it’s the other way around. This was an interesting
        surprise for me. The background I incorporated represnts water in
        reference to the mermaid.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process of this sketch was the most complicated for me so far. I
        haven’t really encountered a lot of organic shapes in the previous
        assignments, so I’m not really familiar with the bezier or vertex
        function. This was my first opportunity to work extensively with the
        vertex and bezierVertex function. It was challenging as first because I
        was having trouble visualizing the coordinates. It took me a while to
        figure out a way to make the process easier. I used the text function to
        make the coordinates of mouseX and mouseY visible. This saved me a lot
        of troubles because I was able to just hover my cursor over the desire
        position to find out the approximate coordinates to sketch.

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        This assignment was really intriguing because it was a combination of
        ideas and sketches from different people. It was extremely fun to see
        different narratives unfold while playing around with different ways of
        assembling. I also learned a lot in terms of coding with this projects.
        I was able to practice and finally figure out easier ways to work with
        the vertex and Bezier function which I’ve deliberately avoid in the
        past. Moreover, I learned to use the User-defined functions, and
        arguments and parameters. It was a good opportunity to practice the idea
        of modularity which makes my codes a lot more condensed and clear.
